# Comparative Analysis of Disease Similarities: A Framework for Model Selection and Fine-Tuning

# Description:
This project focuses on developing effective strategies for fine-tuning convolutional neural network (CNN) models to improve disease identification in medical imaging, particularly when faced with limited labeled data. Leveraging the concept of image profiles, our approach aims to guide the selection of pre-trained base models for fine-tuning by evaluating the structural similarity between diseases in medical images.

# Key Features:
1. Image Profile Generation: We implement a method to generate image profiles for various diseases using the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). These image profiles encapsulate the visual characteristics learned by models during training, providing a nuanced representation of disease features.
2. Model Selection: By comparing the SSIM values between image profiles of fine-tuning diseases and base diseases, our approach assists in selecting the most suitable base models for fine-tuning. This process aims to align the pre-existing knowledge encoded in base models with the specific visual features relevant to the target disease.
3. Fine-Tuning Pipeline: We provide a fine-tuning pipeline that facilitates the training of CNN models on limited labeled data. This pipeline includes hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and performance comparison across different fine-tuning conditions.
4. Evaluation and Analysis: Our project includes evaluation scripts to assess the performance of fine-tuned models in disease identification tasks. We analyze the impact of image similarity metrics on model performance and provide insights into the effectiveness of our approach.

# Future Directions:
- Expansion to Other Modalities: While our current implementation focuses on X-ray images, the framework can be extended to other medical imaging modalities such as MRI or CT scans.
- Integration of Additional Metrics: Future iterations of the project may explore incorporating additional similarity metrics or clinical variables to further enhance model selection and fine-tuning strategies.
- Community Contributions: We welcome contributions from the research and developer community to improve the project's functionality, optimize code efficiency, and expand its applicability to diverse healthcare challenges.
